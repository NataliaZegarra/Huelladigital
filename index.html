      The digital footprint is a ‘trail’ of your digital life. This footprint includes your online activity like your Facebook post, tweets and Instagram pictures. Every time you register for an online service, send an email, download a video or upload a photo, the information can be accessed and your digital footprint can be revealed.

    <p>TIPS FOR TAKING CARE OF YOUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="conten1">
    <p>
      Be cautious with social media:
      Even if you adopt stronger privacy settings, you still should be judicious about what you choose to reveal about yourself online.<br>
      Limit your online accounts:
      Having a lot of online accounts leads to a bigger footprint. However, you can quickly reduce your footprint by deleting or deactivating accounts you no longer need.<br>
      Create a spam email address
      Create an account specifically for marketing and other promotions such as store discounts, and limit any identifying information you store on that email account.<br>
      It’s best to only share information with close friends and family members.
